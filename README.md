# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System** – a personalized recommendation engine designed to help users discover movies they'll love based on their interests and preferences. This project demonstrates the application of **machine learning techniques** and **natural language processing (NLP)** in building a scalable and intelligent recommendation system.

## 🧠 What is a Recommendation System?

Recommendation systems are a subclass of information filtering systems that seek to predict the *rating* or *preference* a user would give to an item. In this project, we focus on recommending movies by analyzing movie metadata and user interactions. Our goal is to deliver accurate and meaningful suggestions to users from a vast dataset.

## 📌 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a **content-based movie recommendation system** that suggests movies similar to a selected movie by comparing features such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview. The system aims to:

- 🎯 Enhance the movie discovery experience  
- 🎯 Help users find relevant content tailored to their tastes  
- 🎯 Explore and implement popular ML techniques for text-based similarity

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ **Content-Based Filtering** using movie metadata  
- ✅ **Cosine Similarity** on TF-IDF Vectors  
- ✅ Integration of **genres, cast, crew, and movie descriptions**  
- ✅ Scalable design using **Pandas** and **Scikit-learn**  
- ✅ User-friendly interface through **Jupyter Notebooks** *(can be adapted to Flask for deployment)*

## 📂 Dataset

We use the **TMDB (The Movie Database)** dataset which contains rich metadata about thousands of movies. The key features include:

- 🎥 Movie titles  
- 🧾 Overview (plot summary)  
- 🏷️ Genres  
- 👥 Cast and crew  
- 🔑 Keywords and tags  

Data preprocessing is performed to combine relevant features and handle missing/null values.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Merge relevant features like *overview, genres, cast, crew,* and *keywords* into a single text column  
   - Use NLP techniques (*tokenization, stemming*) to clean the text  

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Apply **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text data into numerical form  
   - Compute **Cosine Similarity** between movie vectors  

3. **Recommendation Logic**  
   - Input a movie name  
   - Calculate similarity scores with all other movies  
   - Return the top N most similar movies
